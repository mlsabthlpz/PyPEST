10-23-2018
- updated default timing and PEST parameters in config files
- moved stimulus options closer together on screen
- added option to use response box/mouse and checkbox for this on the settings menu
- made it so experiment detects screen size and fills screen (need to see how this 
  works on others' computers); this is not actual "full screen" currently because
  it made it more difficult to exit the program when testing





TO DO
- Add validation to the settings GUI (e.g., make sure all the time intervals are numbers, etc.)
